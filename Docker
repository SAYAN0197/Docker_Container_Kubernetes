##### This Document is specially for the Docker Basic understanding #########
### What is Docker?
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.




####Process for install Docker in the Local machine######
yum update -y             // 
yum install docker -y     // To install docker in the Local Machine 
systemctl start docker    // To start docker (after the docker installation of docker we need to restart the docker)
systemctl status docker   //To check the docker status

**Initially after installing the docker it is not started automatically so we need to start it manually.

docker version            //To check the Docker version
docker info (docker client)
docker run <container name> //To create a docker container

***By default container runs in the attached mode
docker run ubuntu
docker run nginx

*** To run Container in detach mode we need to execute the docker run the command with -d(detach mode) 
docker run -d nginx      //create a docker container in detach mode
 
docker ps                //To see the created running process 
docker ps -a             // To see any kind of process
docker stop <container name> // To stop a container

***To remove a container you must stop the container first. 
docker container prune   //To remove all stopped container

***To create a container we always need an image.
  Images can be stored locally (on your desktop) or remotely (Docker Hub repository), where it found the images it pulled the images.||| https://hub.docker.com/
  Image is a filesystem from where you can create a container
 docker images //Show all the docker images 

***To remove an image.
docker rmi <image name>   //To remove the docker images
docker pull <image name>   //To pull the image from any repository
docker image inspect <image name> //To show the metadata related to images

***Docker daemon: The backend services the Docker
NB: If there is no process running the docker container will automatically go down.

docker run ubuntu ps -ef   //To check any running process docker container.

docker run --it ubuntu bash  //create a new container and get inside the docker container(--it: inside the terminal)
docker exec -it <container id> bash  // get inside a running container
Cd /var/lib/docker //root directory for docker

***TO INSTALL THE COMMAND THAT ARE NOT PRESENT IN THE DOCKER
apt update -y
apt install iputils-ping  //to enable the ping command inside the container
